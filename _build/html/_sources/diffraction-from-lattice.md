# Diffraction from a repeating lattice

An incident beam of photons passing through a real space lattice forms a diffraction pattern of a reciprocal lattice, this is illustrated in the figure below:

In the same way that the above applies to a one-dimensional lattice, it applies to a three-dimensional lattice. Incident photons passing through a three-dimensional lattice diffract to form a three-dimensional reciprocal lattice.

This form of Bragg’s Law illustrates the idea that the closest distance between planes that are scattering constructing differently (d) provides the below form of Bragg’s Law

$$
d = \lambda/(2sin\theta)
$$
