# Recap

A Fourier Series describes the series of waves which can be summed to reproduce some initial function.

The nature of diffraction is such that the constructive interference of the diffracted quanta form a 3-Dimensional Fourier Transform. A 2-D projection of this transform is what is recorded by the machine’s detector.

The waves of the Fourier Transform, just like any other waves, have three core properties:

- Frequency
    - The frequency of each wave is determined by its diffraction angle off the subject, or the location of the specified peak on the detector
- Amplitude
    - The amplitude of each wave is recorded by the intensities of the peak on the detector
- Phase
    - The phase of the waves is lost during data collection

# The Phase Problem

Recall that one of the largest issues a crystallographer faces is known as the phase problem. This problem arises from the fact that no detector has been built that can determine the phase of an incoming X-ray. This is largely because the wavelength of X-rays is so small that each degree in phase is far too minuscule to determine. It is for this reason that structure factor amplitudes may be represented as circles rather than vectors, the information describing the direction of the vector is lost.

[Here we see the result of the wavelets of four different atoms constructively interfering to form a structure factor in reciprocal space. This example implies that the phase information of the wavelets was recorded, which is not the case in practice.](https://github.com/shervinnia/m230bmanims/blob/main/phasing/media/videos/phasing/1080p60/StructFactor.mp4?raw=true)

Here we see the result of the wavelets of four different atoms constructively interfering to form a structure factor in reciprocal space. This example implies that the phase information of the wavelets was recorded, which is not the case in practice.

In reality, we only know $|F|$, not it’s direction/phase. There are several methods used to get around this missing information.
